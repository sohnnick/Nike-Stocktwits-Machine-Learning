# NKE Stocktwits Machine Learning
I first conducted exploratory analysis using Tableau to analyze stock price trends for Nike. 
Then I organized the StockTwits text data into TF-IDF metrics, moving averages, and polarities.
Lastly, I conducted Naive-Bayes classification on whether the stock price would go up or down based on term frequencies.
High accuracy for training data but extremely overfit as test accuracy was low.
